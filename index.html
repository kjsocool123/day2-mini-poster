  <h3>Make sure you Listen to others</h3>

  <!-- Body text -->
  <p>Listening is important because it helps you understand what people are saying and shows that you care. It makes it easier to get along with others and keeps things from getting confusing. When you really listen, people are more likely to listen to you too.</p>
